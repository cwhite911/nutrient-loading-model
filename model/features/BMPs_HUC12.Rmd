library(reshape2) # (tidy) R provides a variety of methods for reshaping data prior to analysis.
library(dplyr) # (tidy) dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:
library(lme4) # lme4 provides functions for fitting and analyzing mixed models: linear (lmer), generalized linear(glmer) and nonlinear (nlmer.)
library(ggplot2) # (tidy) gplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics
library(xlsx) # Provide R functions to read/write/format Excel 2007 and Excel 97/2000/XP/2003 file formats.
library(rstan) # Stan is a state-of-the-art platform for statistical modeling and high-performance statistical computation. 
library(rstudioapi) # Access the RStudio API (if available) and provide informative error messages when it's not.
library(loo)  # Efficient Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation and WAIC for Bayesian Models
library(MASS) # Support Functions and Datasets for Venables and Ripley's MASS
library(rcompanion) # Functions to Support Extension Education Program Evaluation
library(ggpubr) # 'ggplot2' Based Publication Ready Plots
library(matrixStats) # Functions that Apply to Rows and Columns of Matrices (and to Vectors)
library(pacman) # Package Management Tool
library(cowplot) # add-on to ggplot. It provides various features that help with creating publication-quality figures, such as a set of themes, functions to align plots and arrange them into complex compound figures, and functions that make it easy to annotate plots and or mix plots with images.
library(hexbin) # Bivariate Binning Into Hexagon Cells
